      <p>Siddhartha Joshi is a Blogger, Designer, Travel Writer, and Photographer. He likes traveling and sharing memorable moments from his travels in the form of stories and pictures to inspire others to live a life full of wonder. ‘The Wanderer’, as he calls himself says his travels are all about wandering around, exploring the place with wonder and curiosity, meeting people he has never met before, enjoying new experiences and living in the moment.</p>

      <p><strong>Motivation to travel –</strong> The people that I meet during travels…<br><br>
        <strong>Top bucket List Destination –</strong> Greenland, Iran, Mongolia<br><br>
        <strong>Biggest travel inspiration –</strong> Too many to name just one<br><br>
        <strong>Strangest food item you’ve tasted –</strong> Turtle shell soup in Singapore, especially because I am vegetarian<br><br>
        <strong>A story from your travels –</strong> It’s always about my last trip – right now it’s stories of Sikkim, especially how it was independent country till the 1970s and how it then ended up becoming a part of India. I am always fascinated with history when traveling and incorporate it into my travel stories..</p>

      <h2>2. Kamya – Wandering Kamya</h2>
      <h5>Wandering Kamya, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
      <img src="https://static-blog.treebo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kamya.jpg" height="400px" alt="">
      <p>Kamya travels the world on a budget and shares her crazy experiences on her blog Wandering Kamya. After completing her Masters in economics from Warwick University in 2015, she took a year out for traveling around South East Asia. Eventually, one year stretched to three, and digital nomadism became her way of life.</p>
      <p><strong>Motivation to travel – </strong>Travelling is my lifestyle; I have been on the road for about 3 years now, and so for me, it’s more of a way of life than a motivation. I guess this lifestyle comes natural to me because I like to continuously explore new places and lose myself.<br><br>
        <strong> bucket List Destination –</strong> I still haven’t been to South America, also Iceland, New Zealand, French Polynesia and Alaska are up there too.<br><br>
        <strong>Biggest travel inspiration –</strong> Travelling itself is my only inspiration; I don’t feel particularly inspired by anyone to travel. I mostly appreciate people for photography, writing, or information they share, when it comes to travelling.<br><br>
        <strong>Strangest food item you’ve tasted –</strong> I’m a vegetarian, so I don’t eat insects or animals. I guess the strangest tasting food I know of is magic mushrooms.<br><br>
        <strong>A story from your travels –</strong> It’s a funny question because I upload stories on Instagram pretty much every day, and they keep changing. And similarly, I don’t really talk to enough people to keep repeating any certain story. In fact, one of the things I love about the movement is how you can easily forget things and create new things. Some of my stories are too far out to be typed though.</p>

      <p>Lucknow has always been a multicultural city that flourished as a North Indian cultural 
        and artistic hub, and the seat of power of Nawabs in the 18th
         and 19th centuries.</p>
